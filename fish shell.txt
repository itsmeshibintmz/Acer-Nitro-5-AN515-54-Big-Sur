Advanced
---------
Oh My Fish installer adds a snippet to fish's user config files (~/.config/fish/conf.d/) which calls OMF's startup code.

Notice that the scripts in that directory are sourced in the order that the filesystem sees them, and so it may be necessary to prefix your script files with ordering numbers.

For example: a_script.fish will take precedence over the omf.fish snippet. So if a_script.fish depends on plugins managed by OMF, consider renaming the script file to xx_a_script.fish.

Similarly, to make sure that a script runs before omf.fish, you may prefix it with 00_. Alternatively, ~/.config/omf/before.init.fish may be used.

Startup
---------
Every time you open a new shell, the startup code initializes Oh My Fish installation path and the config path (~/.config/omf by default), sourcing the init.fish script afterwards, which autoloads packages, themes and your custom init files.
