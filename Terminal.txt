1: Install Homebrew from brew.sh
2: Install fish shell by brew install fish 
    After that set Shells open with command /usr/local/bin/fish in Terminal preferences, General Tab 
3: Change default shell to fish shell by chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish
4: Install lolcat with brew : brew install lolcat
5: Install cowsay with brew : brew install cowsay fortune 
7: Combine 4,5 Steps and import andinstall all brew softwares I've already installed : brew bundle (Downlod brewfile from repository and type command from the location where brewfile is copied Eg: copy brewfile to Downloads. Open Terminal in Downloads folder and type : brew bundle )
In our case : Either rename it to Brewfile, or run brew bundle --file=Brewfile.txt instead.
6: Add cowsay to startup of Terminal by : vim ~/.config/fish/config.fish
    if status is-interactive
    # Commands to run in interactive sessions can go here
    function fish_greeting
        set -l toon (random choice {default,bud-frogs,dragon,dragon-and-cow,elephant,moose,stegosaurus,tux,vader})
         fortune -s | cowsay -f $toon | lolcat
        echo Welcome _cafe_phile_
    end
